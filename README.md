Fast, brutalist UI on top of RipGrep

"You RipGrep, so why not RoughGrep?" -Anon, 2018

## Installation

Grab it from [Releases](https://github.com/vivainio/RoughGrep/releases) and unzip somewhere. Works best when you can
launch it from command line.

If you want to install RoughGrep for Explorer right click context menu, run "rgg --install" as administator.

You can also install with Scoop:

```
$ winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC

# install scoop (in PowerShell)
$ iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')

# install scoop extras
$ scoop bucket add extras

# finally, install roughgrep
$ scoop install roughgrep
```

## Requirements

- Microsoft Windows (R)
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 (because Windows Forms font rendering is broken on the old ones)
- VSCode launcher ("code") on PATH

## Usage

- Go to the directory you want to search from in prompt of your choice.
- Run rgg.exe. You may also add ripgrep command line arguments, e.g. `rgg -g *.fs` to restrict the search to glob pattern
- Enter the search string in the box and press enter.
- Navigate the results. When you find interesting result you can:
  - Press `space` to open the file at line in preview window
  - Press `ENTER` to open it in VSCode
  - Press `p` to open the parent project DIRECTORY in vscode. RoughGrep takes the best guess on what that might be (e.g. finds .csproj).
  - Press `n` to create a note from current line (and file) to scratchpad window. If there is selection, it's
    appended instead of just the line.
  - Press `g` to view git history for the file in `gitk`.
  - Press `b` to open `git blame` view of the file, with current line focused. Spread the guilt!
  - Press `l` to open `git log -p` view of the file. Useful to search deeper than what "git blame" shows you.
  - Press `d` to open containing folder in Windows file explorer.
  - Press `F12` ('go to definition) to search for the word under cursor, or the currently selected text.

- You can modify RipGrep command line arguments after launch by clicking the ComboBox from the Status Bar.
- If you want to *find file names* instead of finding contents, use the `--files` command line argument.
  Then, the "text to search for" inputs becomes the list of glob patterns instead.
- Configurable in Scheme! Undocumented, but [you get the idea](https://github.com/vivainio/RoughGrep/blob/master/RoughGrep/RoughGrep.ss).
